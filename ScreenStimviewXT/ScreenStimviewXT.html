							<li>Relevant fiber geometry taken into account (Node Ranvier, myelin sheath, etc.)</li>
							<li>
								Assume most activatable fibers by diameter and orientation (perpendicular to electrode) and mostly (except encapsulation layer), homogenous (conductivity behaves same across tissues), and isotropic environment (conductivity is same in each direction). AKA: Does not include patient-specific anisotropies or inhomogeneities in the tissue, nor patient-specific fiber orientations or locations.
								<ul>
									<li>Differential equations of ion channels are used to determine model fiber's reaction to stimulation - Does it fire or not?</li>
									<li>A field of these model axons sugest a picture of tissue response to stimulation</li>
